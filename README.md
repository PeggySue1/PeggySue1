<strong> more 'bout me </strong>


Like I said, I struggle with keepin' conversations and even if I'm tryin' to not, I'm bein' akward instead | It might be hard to talk with me first, but I get very comfortable after a while, maybe even too much comfortable? If I'm 'bein weird tell me! 'couse my weird jokes are kinda stupid (-_-; I think bein' honest is a really important thing, specially to me. I hate when someone has a problem and they are just tryin' to avoid me or smthhhh... please, tell me whats wrong, I won't be mad... okayyy? | If I want to be friends rlly bad, I tend to be annoyin', tell me to stop, please.
